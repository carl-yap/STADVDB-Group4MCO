# Distributed Database Concurrency Control Strategy

## Isolation Level Selection Rationale

### Scenario Analysis
1. **Read Scenarios (Case #1)**
   - **Isolation Level**: Read Committed
   - **Justification**:
     * Prevents dirty reads
     * Allows multiple concurrent read transactions
     * Minimizes lock contention
     * Ensures data consistency while maintaining high throughput

2. **Mixed Read-Write Scenarios (Case #2)**
   - **Isolation Level**: Repeatable Read
   - **Justification**:
     * Prevents non-repeatable reads
     * Protects read transactions from write interference
     * Ensures consistent snapshot for reading transactions
     * Prevents phantom reads

3. **Concurrent Write Scenarios (Case #3)**
   - **Isolation Level**: Serializable
   - **Justification**:
     * Prevents write conflicts
     * Ensures complete transaction isolation
     * Guarantees data integrity during concurrent writes
     * Prevents all concurrency anomalies

## Concurrency Control Mechanisms

### Transaction Management
- Unique transaction ID generation
- Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol
- Distributed transaction logging
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Replication Strategy
1. Synchronous replication
2. Conflict resolution using:
   - Timestamp-based versioning
   - Last-write-wins conflict resolution
