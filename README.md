TODO (after acquiring a local copy):
- Unzip the data source from `data/games_fixed.zip`. There should only be `games_fixed.csv` in the `data` folder.
- Open `MCO1.ipynb` with Jupyter in a conda environment or VSC using the relevant extensions.
- Run all cells to (1) create the data warehouse, (2) ETL into all tables, and (3) load the prepared OLAP visualizations.
